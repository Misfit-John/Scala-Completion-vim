# Scala-Completion-vim
Still very buggy scala vim completion plugin based on [Scala-completion-base](https://github.com/johnzeng/Scala-completion-Base)

It's working now, but, ahh, yet very slow. It's cased by compiler invoking, so I don't have any idea so far. I think it will help if I make a Server-Client architecture for it. But it's not necessary so far.

I think this will be enough for you when you don't know what APIs do you have when you are facing a strange package


# Currently supported feature
- completion for symbol
- completion for import

# need to be supported
- third party jar lib including.
- (maybe) sbt support.
- (maybe) CS architecture to boost the plugin.
